# [Technical Documentation page](https://aemann2.github.io/tech_doc/)

This was my attempt to emulate a documentation page on the [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) website -- specifically, their [guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Something I don't like about their guide is the amount of blank space at the end of the shorter column, so I tried to improve that. I also added a **side-nav** and a **dark mode** (to see what all the fuss was about).

## Background:

I'd just learned about SVG images and the CSS `::before` and `::after` selectors, so I wanted to put those to use here. I still hadn't heard of Figma, however, so the SVG design I came up with isn't quite as good as the one on CSS Tricks website. I tried to use more semantic HTML than I'd used in the past, so the code is better in that way. Unfortunately, I still didn't know SASS so the CSS is more complicated than it needs to be, and I think the side-nav could have been implemented better. I'd built the Dark Mode in a tutorial somewhere along the way, so I decided to include it in this project.

## Technology:

HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## What I learned or used for the first time:

- **Javascript for DOM manipulation**
- **Dark mode**
- **An alternative CSS file**
- **CSS Grid**
- **The Flexbox `flex` property**
- **A side-nav**
- **An SVG "swoop"**
- **A background gradient**
- **Styled scrollbars**
